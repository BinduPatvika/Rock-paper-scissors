The program asks the user to choose between "rock", "paper", or "scissors".The computer randomly selects one of the options.
The program compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner based on the rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
If both choose the same, it's a tie.
The result (whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie) is then printed out.
